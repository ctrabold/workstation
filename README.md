# workstation

An approach to configure my dev workstation while learning ansible. Very much WIP

My goal is to reduce the manual steps when installing my Macbook and Ubuntu machine to a minimum.

Because it's boring.

I also use this repo to document my experience with Ansible.

Because it's fun.


# Important

I use this repo to learn a new tool. Thus I consider the content unstable.

Use at your own risk. Thanks!
