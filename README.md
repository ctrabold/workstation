# workstation

An approach to configure my dev workstation while learning ansible. Very much WIP

My goal is to reduce the manual steps when installing my Macbook and Ubuntu machine to a minimum.

Because it's boring.

I also use this repo to document my experience with Ansible.

Because it's fun.


# Important

I use this repo to learn a new tool. Thus I consider the content unstable.

Use at your own risk. Thanks!


# Howtos

Q: How do I see a list of all of the ansible_ variables?
A: Run this command

    ansible -m setup localhost -i hosts.ini


# TODOs / ideas

- Check if homebrew is outdated
- Fix rubygems install issues
- Add more Apps / create custom casks
