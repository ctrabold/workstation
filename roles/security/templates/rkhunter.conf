#
# Most of the following options need only be specified once. If
# they appear more than once, then the last one seen will be used.
# Some options are allowed to appear more than once, and the text
# describing the option will say if this is so.
#
# Some of the options are space-separated lists of pathnames. If
# wildcard characters (globbing) are allowed in the list, then the
# text describing the option will say so.
#
# Space-separated lists may be enclosed by quotes, but these must only
# appear at the start and end of the list, not in the middle.
#
# For example:    XXX="abc  def  gh"        (correct)
#                 XXX="abc"  "def"  "gh"    (incorrect)
#


#
# If this option is set to 1, it specifies that the mirrors file
# ('mirrors.dat'), which is used when the '--update' and '--versioncheck'
# options are used, is to be rotated. Rotating the entries in the file
# allows a basic form of load-balancing between the mirror sites whenever
# the above options are used.
# If the option is set to 0, then the mirrors will be treated as if in
# a priority list. That is, the first mirror listed will always be used
# first. The second mirror will only be used if the first mirror fails,
# the third mirror will only be used if the second mirror fails, and so on.
#
# If the mirrors file is read-only, then the '--versioncheck' command-line
# option can only be used if this option is set to 0.
#
ROTATE_MIRRORS=1

#
# If this option is set to 1, it specifies that when the '--update'
# option is used, then the mirrors file is to be checked for updates
# as well. If the current mirrors file contains any local mirrors,
# these will be prepended to the updated file.
# If this option is set to 0, the mirrors file can only be updated
# manually. This may be useful if only using local mirrors.
#
UPDATE_MIRRORS=1

#
# The MIRRORS_MODE option tells rkhunter which mirrors are to be
# used when the '--update' or '--versioncheck' command-line options
# are given. Possible values are:
#     0 - use any mirror (the default)
#     1 - only use local mirrors
#     2 - only use remote mirrors
#
# Local and remote mirrors can be defined in the mirrors file
# by using the 'local=' and 'remote=' keywords respectively.
#
MIRRORS_MODE=0

#
# Email a message to this address if a warning is found when the
# system is being checked. Multiple addresses may be specified
# simply be separating them with a space. Setting this option to
# null disables the option.
#
# NOTE: This option should be present in the configuration file.
#
#MAIL-ON-WARNING=me@mydomain   root@mydomain

# NOTE: Double quotes are not required around the command, but
# are required around the subject line if it contains spaces.
#
MAIL_CMD=mail -s "[rkhunter] Warnings found for ${HOST_NAME}"

#
# Specify the temporary directory to use.
#
# NOTE: Do not use /tmp as your temporary directory. Some
# important files will be written to this directory, so be
# sure that the directory permissions are tight.
#
TMPDIR=/var/lib/rkhunter/tmp

#
# Specify the database directory to use.
#
DBDIR=/var/lib/rkhunter/db

#
# Specify the script directory to use.
#
SCRIPTDIR=/usr/share/rkhunter/scripts

#
# This option can be used to modify the command directory list used
# by rkhunter to locate commands (that is, its PATH). By default
# this will be the root PATH, and an internal list of some common
# command directories.
#
# Any directories specified here will, by default, be appended to the
# default list. However, if a directory name begins with the '+'
# character, then that directory will be prepended to the list (that
# is, it will be put at the start of the list).
#
# This is a space-separated list of directory names. The option may
# be specified more than once.
#
#BINDIR="/bin /usr/bin /sbin /usr/sbin"
#BINDIR="+/usr/local/bin +/usr/local/sbin"

#
# Specify the default language to use. This should be similar
# to the ISO 639 language code.
#
# NOTE: Please ensure that the language you specify is supported.
# For a list of supported languages use the following command:
#
#       rkhunter --lang en --list languages
#
#LANGUAGE=en

#
# This option is a space-separated list of the languages that are to
# be updated when the '--update' option is used. If unset, then all
# the languages will be updated. If none of the languages are to be
# updated, then set this option to just 'en'.
#
# The default is for all the languages to be updated. The default
# language, specified above, and the English (en) language file will
# always be updated regardless of this option.
#
UPDATE_LANG=""

#
# Specify the log file pathname.
#
# NOTE: This option should be present in the configuration file.
#
LOGFILE=/var/log/rkhunter.log

#
# Set the following option to 1 if the log file is to be appended to
# whenever rkhunter is run.
#
APPEND_LOG=0

#
# Set the following option to 1 if the log file is to be copied when
# rkhunter finishes and an error or warning has occurred. The copied
# log file name will be appended with the current date and time
# (in YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS format).
# For example: rkhunter.log.2009-04-21_00:57:51
#
COPY_LOG_ON_ERROR=0

#
# Set the following option to enable the rkhunter check start and finish
# times to be logged by syslog. Warning messages will also be logged.
# The value of the option must be a standard syslog facility and
# priority, separated by a dot.  For example:
#
#     USE_SYSLOG=authpriv.warning
#
# Setting the value to 'none', or just leaving the option commented out,
# disables the use of syslog.
#
#USE_SYSLOG=authpriv.notice

#
# Set the following option to 1 if the second colour set is to be used.
# This can be useful if your screen uses black characters on a white
# background (for example, a PC instead of a server).
#
COLOR_SET2=0

#
# Set the following option to 0 if rkhunter should not detect if X is
# being used. If X is detected as being used, then the second colour
# set will automatically be used.
#
AUTO_X_DETECT=1

#
# Set the following option to 1 if it is wanted that any 'Whitelisted'
# results are shown in white rather than green. For colour set 2 users,
# setting this option will cause the result to be shown in black.
#
WHITELISTED_IS_WHITE=0

#
# The following option is checked against the SSH configuration file
# 'PermitRootLogin' option. A warning will be displayed if they do not
# match. However, if a value has not been set in the SSH configuration
# file, then a value here of 'unset' can be used to avoid warning messages.
# This option has a default value of 'no'.
#
ALLOW_SSH_ROOT_USER=no

#
# Set this option to '1' to allow the use of the SSH-1 protocol, but note
# that theoretically it is weaker, and therefore less secure, than the
# SSH-2 protocol. Do not modify this option unless you have good reasons
# to use the SSH-1 protocol (for instance for AFS token passing or Kerberos4
# authentication). If the 'Protocol' option has not been set in the SSH
# configuration file, then a value of '2' may be set here in order to
# suppress a warning message. This option has a default value of '0'.
#
ALLOW_SSH_PROT_V1=0

#
# This setting tells rkhunter the directory containing the SSH configuration
# file. This setting will be worked out by rkhunter, and so should not
# usually need to be set.
#
#SSH_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/ssh

#
# These two options determine which tests are to be performed.
# The ENABLE_TESTS option can use the word 'all' to refer to all the
# available tests. The DISABLE_TESTS option can use the word 'none' to
# mean that no tests are disabled. The list of disabled tests is applied to
# the list of enabled tests. Both options are space-separated lists of test
# names. The currently available test names can be seen by using the command
# 'rkhunter --list tests'.
#
# The program defaults are to enable all tests and disable none. However, if
# either of the options below are specified, then they will override the
# program defaults.
#
# The supplied configuration file has some tests already disabled, and these
# are tests that will be used only occasionally, can be considered
# "advanced" or that are prone to produce more than the average number of
# false-positives.
#
# Please read the README file for more details about enabling and disabling
# tests, the test names, and how rkhunter behaves when these options are used.
#
# hidden_procs test requires the unhide command which is part of the unhide
# package in Debian.
#
# apps test is disabled by default as it triggers warnings about outdated
# applications (and warns about possible security risk: we better trust
# the Debian Security Team).
#
ENABLE_TESTS="all"
DISABLE_TESTS="suspscan hidden_procs deleted_files packet_cap_apps apps"

#
# The HASH_FUNC option can be used to specify the command to use
# for the file hash value check. It can be specified as just the
# command name or the full pathname. If just the command name is
# given, and it is one of MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 or
# SHA512, then rkhunter will first look for the relevant command,
# such as 'sha256sum', and then for 'sha256'. If neither of these
# are found, it will then look to see if a perl module has been
# installed which will support the relevant hash function. To see
# which perl modules have been installed use the command
# 'rkhunter --list perl'.
#
# The default is SHA1, or MD5 if SHA1 cannot be found.
#
# Systems using prelinking are restricted to using either the
# SHA1 or MD5 function.
#
# A value of 'NONE' (in uppercase) can be specified to indicate that
# no hash function should be used. Rootkit Hunter will detect this and
# automatically disable the file hash checks.
#
# Examples:
#   For Solaris 9 : HASH_FUNC=gmd5sum
#   For Solaris 10: HASH_FUNC=sha1sum
#   For AIX (>5.2): HASH_FUNC="csum -hMD5"
#   For NetBSD    : HASH_FUNC="cksum -a sha512"
#
# NOTE: If the hash function is changed then you MUST run rkhunter with
# the '--propupd' option to rebuild the file properties database.
#
#HASH_FUNC=sha1sum

#
# The HASH_FLD_IDX option specifies which field from the HASH_FUNC
# command output contains the hash value. The fields are assumed to
# be space-separated. The default value is 1, but for *BSD users
# rkhunter will, by default, use a value of 4 if the HASH_FUNC option
# has not been set. The option value must be an integer greater
# than zero.
#
#HASH_FLD_IDX=4

#
# The PKGMGR option tells rkhunter to use the specified package manager
# to obtain the file property information. This is used when updating
# the file properties file ('rkhunter.dat'), and when running the file
# properties check. For RedHat/RPM-based systems, 'RPM' can be used to
# get information from the RPM database. For Debian-based systems 'DPKG'
# can be used, for *BSD systems 'BSD' can be used, and for Solaris
# systems 'SOLARIS' can be used. No value, or a value of 'NONE',
# indicates that no package manager is to be used. The default is 'NONE'.
#
# The current package managers, except 'SOLARIS', store the file hash
# values using an MD5 hash function. The Solaris package manager includes
# a checksum value, but this is not used by default (see USE_SUNSUM below).
#
# The 'DPKG' and 'BSD' package managers only provide MD5 hash values.
# The 'RPM' package manager additionally provides values for the inode,
# file permissions, uid, gid and other values. The 'SOLARIS' also provides
# most of the values, similar to 'RPM', but not the inode number.
#
# For any file not part of a package, rkhunter will revert to using the
# HASH_FUNC hash function instead.
#
# Whenever this option is changed 'rkhunter --propupd' must be run.
#
# NONE is the default for Debian as well, as running --propupd takes
# about 4 times longer when it's set to DPKG
#
#PKGMGR=NONE

#
# It is possible that a file which is part of a package may be modified
# by the administrator. Typically this occurs for configuration files.
# However, the package manager may list the file as being modified. For
# the RPM package manager this may well depend on how the package was
# built. This option specifies those pathnames which are to be exempt
# from the package manager verification process, and which will be treated
# as non-packaged files. As such, the file properties are still checked.
#
# This option only takes effect if the PKGMGR option has been set, and
# is not 'NONE'.
#
# This is a space-separated list of pathnames. The option may
# be specified more than once.
#
# Whenever this option is changed 'rkhunter --propupd' must be run.
#
#PKGMGR_NO_VRFY=""

#
# This option can be used to tell rkhunter to ignore any prelink
# dependency errors for the given commands. However, a warning will also
# be issued if the error does not occur for a given command. As such
# this option must only be used on commands which experience a persistent
# problem.
#
# Short-term prelink dependency errors can usually be resolved simply by
# running the 'prelink' command on the given pathname.
#
# NOTE: The command 'rkhunter --propupd' must be run whenever this option
# is changed.
#
# This is a space-separated list of command pathnames. The option can be
# specified more than once.
#
#IGNORE_PRELINK_DEP_ERR="/bin/ps /usr/bin/top"

#
# If the 'SOLARIS' package manager is used, then it is possible to use
# the checksum (hash) value stored for a file. However, this is only a
# 16-bit checksum, and as such is not nearly as secure as, for example,
# a SHA-2 value. For that reason, the checksum is not used by default,
# and the hash function given by HASH_FUNC is used instead. To enable
# this option, set its value to 1. The Solaris 'sum' command must be
# present on the system if this option is used.
#
#USE_SUNSUM=0

#
# This option is a space-separated list of commands, directories and file
# pathnames which will be included in the file properties checks.
# This option can be specified more than once.
#
# Whenever this option is changed, 'rkhunter --propupd' must be run.
#
# Simple command names - for example, 'top' - and directory names are
# added to the internal list of directories to be searched for each of
# the command names in the command list. Additionally, full pathnames
# to files, which need not be commands, may be given. Any files or
# directories which are already part of the internal lists will be
# silently ignored from the configuration.
#
# Normal globbing wildcards are allowed, except for simple command names.
# For example, 'top*' cannot be given, but '/usr/bin/top*' is allowed.
#
# Specific files may be excluded by preceding their name with an
# exclamation mark (!). For example, '!/opt/top'. By combining this
# with wildcarding, whole directories can be excluded. For example,
# '/etc/* /etc/*/* !/etc/rc?.d/*'. This will look for files in the first
# two directory levels of '/etc'. However, anything in '/etc/rc0.d',
# '/etc/rc1.d', '/etc/rc2.d' and so on, will be excluded.
#
# NOTE: Only files and directories which have been added by the user,
# and are not part of the internal lists, can be excluded. So, for
# example, it is not possible to exclude the 'ps' command by using
# '!/bin/ps'. These will be silently ignored from the configuration.

#
# This option whitelists files and directories from existing,
# or not existing, on the system at the time of testing. This
# option is used when the configuration file options themselves
# are checked, and during the file properties check, the hidden
# files and directories checks, and the filesystem check of the
# '/dev' directory.
#
# This is a space-separated list of pathnames. The option may be
# specified more than once. The option may use wildcard characters,
# but be aware that this is probably not what you want to do as the
# wildcarding will be expanded after files have been deleted. As
# such deleted files won't be whitelisted if wildcarded.
#
# NOTE: The user must take into consideration how often the file will
# appear and disappear from the system in relation to how often
# rkhunter is run. If the file appears, and disappears, too often
# then rkhunter may not notice this. All it will see is that the file
# has changed. The inode-number and DTM will certainly be different
# for each new file, and rkhunter will report this.

# Allow the following applications, or a specific version of an application,
# to be whitelisted. This option may be specified more than once, and is a
# space-separated list consisting of the application names. If a specific
# version is to be whitelisted, then the name must be followed by a colon
# and then the version number. For example:
#
#     APP_WHITELIST="openssl:0.9.7d gpg httpd:1.3.29"
#
# Note above that for the Apache web server, the name 'httpd' is used.
#

# Scan for suspicious files in directories containing temporary files and
# directories posing a relatively higher risk due to user write access.
# Please do not enable by default as suspscan is CPU and I/O intensive and prone to
# producing false positives. Do review all settings before usage.
# Also be aware that running suspscan in combination with verbose logging on,
# RKH's default, will show all ignored files.
# Please consider adding all directories the user the (web)server runs as has
# write access to including the document root (example: "/var/www") and log
# directories (example: "/var/log/httpd").
#
# This is a space-separated list of directory pathnames.
# The option may be specified more than once.
#
#SUSPSCAN_DIRS="/tmp /var/tmp"

#
# Directory for temporary files. A memory-based one is better (faster).
# Do not use a directory name that is listed in SUSPSCAN_DIRS.
# Please make sure you have a tempfs mounted and the directory exists.

#
# The following option can be used to whitelist network ports which
# are known to have been used by malware. This option may be specified
# more than once. The option is a space-separated list of one or more
# of four types of whitelisting. These are:
#
#   1) a 'protocol:port' pair       (e.g. TCP:25)
#   2) a pathname to an executable  (e.g. /usr/sbin/squid)
#   3) a combined pathname, protocol and port
#                                   (e.g. /usr/sbin/squid:TCP:3801)
#   4) an asterisk ('*')
#
# Only the UDP or TCP protocol may be specified, and the port number
# must be between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
#
# The asterisk can be used to indicate that any executable which rkhunter
# can locate as a command, is whitelisted. (See BINDIR in this file.)
#
# For example:
#
#     PORT_WHITELIST="/home/user1/abc /opt/xyz TCP:2001 UDP:32011"
#
# NOTE: In order to whitelist a pathname, or use the asterisk option,
# the 'lsof' command must be present.
#
#PORT_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following option can be used to tell rkhunter where the operating
# system 'release' file is located. This file contains information
# specifying the current O/S version. RKH will store this information
# itself, and check to see if it has changed between each run. If it has
# changed, then the user is warned that RKH may issue warning messages
# until RKH has been run with the '--propupd' option.
#
# Since the contents of the file vary according to the O/S distribution,
# RKH will perform different actions when it detects the file itself. As
# such, this option should not be set unless necessary. If this option is
# specified, then RKH will assume the O/S release information is on the
# first non-blank line of the file.
#
#OS_VERSION_FILE="/etc/debian_version"

#
# The following two options can be used to whitelist files and directories
# that would normally be flagged with a warning during the various rootkit
# and malware checks. If the file or directory name contains a space, then
# the percent character ('%') must be used instead. Only existing files and
# directories can be specified, and these must be full pathnames not links.
#
# Additionally, the RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST option may include a string after the
# file name (separated by a colon). This will then only whitelist that string
# in that file (as part of the malware checks). For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST="/etc/rc.local:hdparm"
#
# If the option list includes the filename on its own as well, then the file
# will be whitelisted from rootkit checks of the files existence, but still
# only the specific string within the file will be whitelisted. For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST="/etc/rc.local:hdparm /etc/rc.local"
#
# To whitelist a file from the existence checks, but not from the strings
# checks, then include the filename on its own and on its own but with
# just a colon appended. For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST="/etc/rc.local /etc/rc.local:"
#
# NOTE: It is recommended that if you whitelist any files, then you include
# those files in the file properties check. See the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS
# configuration option.
#
# These are space-separated lists of file and directory pathnames.
# The options may be specified more than once.
#
#RTKT_DIR_WHITELIST=""
#RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following option can be used to whitelist shared library files that would
# normally be flagged with a warning during the preloaded shared library check.
# These library pathnames usually exist in the '/etc/ld.so.preload' file or in
# the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
#
# NOTE: It is recommended that if you whitelist any files, then you include
# those files in the file properties check. See the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS
# configuration option.
#
# This is a space-separated list of library pathnames.
# The option may be specified more than once.
#
#SHARED_LIB_WHITELIST="/lib/snoopy.so"

#
# To force rkhunter to use the supplied script for the 'stat' or 'readlink'
# command, then the following two options can be used. The value must be
# set to 'BUILTIN'.
#
# NOTE: IRIX users will probably need to enable STAT_CMD.
#
#STAT_CMD=BUILTIN
#READLINK_CMD=BUILTIN

#
# In the file properties test any modification date/time is displayed as the
# number of epoch seconds. Rkhunter will try and use the 'date' command, or
# failing that the 'perl' command, to display the date and time in a
# human-readable format as well. This option may be used if some other command
# should be used instead. The given command must understand the '%s' and
# 'seconds ago' options found in the GNU date command.
#
# A value of 'NONE' may be used to request that only the epoch seconds be shown.
# A value of 'PERL' may be used to force rkhunter to use the 'perl' command, if
# it is present.
#
#EPOCH_DATE_CMD=""

#
# This setting tells rkhunter the directory containing the available
# Linux kernel modules. This setting will be worked out by rkhunter,
# and so should not usually need to be set.
#
#MODULES_DIR=""

#
# The following option can be set to a command which rkhunter will use when
# downloading files from the Internet - that is, when the '--update' or
# '--versioncheck' option is used. The command can take options.
#
# This allows the user to use a command other than the one automatically
# selected by rkhunter, but still one which it already knows about.
# For example:
#
#     WEB_CMD=curl
#
# Alternatively, the user may specify a completely new command. However, note
# that rkhunter expects the downloaded file to be written to stdout, and that
# everything written to stderr is ignored. For example:
#
#     WEB_CMD="/opt/bin/dlfile --timeout 5m -q"
#
# *BSD users may want to use the 'ftp' command, provided that it supports
# the HTTP protocol:
#
#     WEB_CMD="ftp -o -"
#
#WEB_CMD=""

#
# Set the following option to 0 if you do not want to receive a warning if
# any O/S information has changed since the last run of 'rkhunter --propupd'.
# The warnings occur during the file properties check. The default is to
# issue a warning if something has changed.
#
#WARN_ON_OS_CHANGE=1

#
# Set the following option to 1 if you want rkhunter to automatically run
# a file properties update ('--propupd') if the O/S has changed. Detection
# of an O/S change occurs during the file properties check. The default is
# not to do an automatic update.
#
# WARNING: Only set this option if you are sure that the update will work
# correctly. That is, that the database directory is writeable, that a valid
# hash function is available, and so on. This can usually be checked simply
# by running 'rkhunter --propupd' at least once.
#
#UPDT_ON_OS_CHANGE=0

#
# Set the following option to 1 if locking is to be used when rkhunter runs.
# The lock is set just before logging starts, and is removed when the program
# ends. It is used to prevent items such as the log file, and the file
# properties file, from becoming corrupted if rkhunter is running more than
# once. The mechanism used is to simply create a lock file in the TMPDIR
# directory. If the lock file already exists, because rkhunter is already
# running, then the current process simply loops around sleeping for 10 seconds
# and then retrying the lock.
#
# The default is not to use locking.
#
USE_LOCKING=0

#
# If locking is used, then rkhunter may have to wait to get the lock file.
# This option sets the total amount of time, in seconds, that rkhunter should
# wait. It will retry the lock every 10 seconds, until either it obtains the
# lock or the timeout value has been reached. If no value is set, then a
# default of 300 seconds (5 minutes) is used.
#
LOCK_TIMEOUT=300

#
# If locking is used, then rkhunter may be doing nothing for some time if it
# has to wait for the lock. Some simple messages are echo'd to the users screen
# to let them know that rkhunter is waiting for the lock. Set this option to 0
# if the messages are not to be displayed. The default is to show them.
#
SHOW_LOCK_MSGS=1

#
# If the option SCANROOTKITMODE is set to "THOROUGH" the scanrootkit() function
# will search (on a per rootkit basis) for filenames in all of the directories (as defined
# by the result of running 'find / -xdev'). While still not optimal, as it
# still searches for only file names as opposed to file contents, this is one step away
# from the rigidity of searching in known (evidence) or default (installation) locations.
#
# THIS OPTION SHOULD NOT BE ENABLED BY DEFAULT.
#
# You should only activate this feature as part of a more thorough investigation which
# should be based on relevant best practices and procedures.
#
# Enabling this feature implies you have the knowledge to interpret the results properly.
#
#SCANROOTKITMODE=THOROUGH

#
# The following option can be set to the name(s) of the tests the 'unhide' command is
# to use. In order to maintain compatibility with older versions of 'unhide', this
# option defaults to 'sys'. Options such as '-m' and '-v' may also be specified, but
# will only take effect when they are seen. The test names are a space-separated list,
# and will be executed in the order given.
#
#UNHIDE_TESTS="sys"

#
# If both the C 'unhide', and Ruby 'unhide.rb', programs exist on the system, then it
# is possible to disable the execution of one of the programs if desired. By default
# rkhunter will look for both programs, and execute each of them as they are found.
# If the value of this option is 0, then both programs will be executed if they are
# present. A value of 1 will disable execution of the C 'unhide' program, and a value
# of 2 will disable the Ruby 'unhide.rb' program. The default value is 0. To disable
# both programs, then disable the 'hidden_procs' test.

DISABLE_UNHIDE=1
